This is an image generation app in which you can use openAi api key to produce images, you have 2 model options either dall-e-2 or dall-e-3 
you can choose the size of the images for each model. For dall-e-2 you can create a max upto 5 images at once and for dall-e-3 you can create 
one image at once , dall-e-3 also has an option for a hd image but that use much more tokens than the normal one.

Just put in your OpenAI api key in the .env file in the backend folder and you are good to go 
Create a variable in .env file 
OPENAI_API_KEY =            <-- put your key here and make sure to create the variable with the same name.
